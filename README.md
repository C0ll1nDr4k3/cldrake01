# Hi there, I'm Collin!

I'm a senior at [Peak to Peak Charter School](https://peaktopeak.org/) and I'm interested in all things databases and ml.

I'm proudest of:

- [NilVec](https://github.com/cldrake01/NilVec) A vector database written in `Zig` and `CUDA` aiming to provide faster filter queries with a different metadata storage paradigm. 
- [sibyl](https://github.com/cldrake01/sibyl) A project that allows me to test various transformers on financial time series data.
- [Student-Aided-Design](https://github.com/Peak-to-Peak-Engineering/Student-Aided-Design) A minimal website where teachers at Peak to Peak can request items and curiculum involving CAD and 3d printing for their classes.
