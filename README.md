# Hi there, I'm Collin!

I'm a junior at [Peak to Peak Charter School](peaktopeak.org) and I'm interested in all things ml.

I'm proudest of:

- [sibyl](https://github.com/cldrake01/sibyl) A project that allows me to test various transformers on financial time series data.
- [Student-Aided-Design](https://github.com/Peak-to-Peak-Engineering/Student-Aided-Design) A minimal website where teachers at Peak to Peak can request items and curiculum involving CAD and 3d printing for their classes.
